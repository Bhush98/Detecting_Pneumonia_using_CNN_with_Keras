Detecting Pneumonia by given Chest Xrays

So, this is a classic image Classification problem, that in deep learning we deal using ConvNets( Convolutional Neural Networks ).
Here in this problem, we are given a data set of Images of chest X_rays of both a Normal person and the affected person and based on this 
X-rays we come with a model, that when given a X-ray will detect if the person has pneumonia or not and it is also a Health Care application
of Deep Learning and AI.

You can find the dataset from the below link :
